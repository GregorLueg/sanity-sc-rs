//! The Wright omega function, solved in the logarithm.
//!
//! `omega(x)` is the solution of `w + ln w = x`. It is the form the Sanity
//! stationarity condition reduces to (SPEC section 2.1, SI eq. 25-26). The
//! Lambert W form of the same equation takes `exp(x)` as its argument, which
//! overflows for ordinary inputs; the Wright form does not and needs no
//! asymptotic branch.
//!
//! Everything here works with `t = ln omega` rather than `omega`. The defining
//! equation becomes `exp(t) + t = x`, which is well conditioned over the whole
//! real line, and `ln omega` is what the caller wants anyway: the log fold
//! change is built from it directly.
//!
