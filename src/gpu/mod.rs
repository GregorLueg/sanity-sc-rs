//! The CubeCL path. Feature-gated on `gpu`, CPU-only build otherwise.
//!
//! Everything on the device is `f32`, because wgpu exposes no `f64` on any
//! backend. That is a departure from the crate's numeric policy, and the reason
//! this path is held to its own measured tolerance rather than to the CPU's.
//!
//! ### Mapping
//!
//! The first pass is [`kernels::sweep_grid_gpu`]: one plane per gene, running
//! the whole variance grid, with each cell sweep reduced across the plane so
//! every lane agrees on the offset solve without a barrier. The host then
//! assembles each bin's log marginal likelihood in `f64` and forms the weights.
//! The second pass is [`kernels::marginalise_gpu`]: one thread per gene and
//! cell, integrating over the kept bins with the offsets the first pass left
//! on the device.
//!
//! ### Precision
//!
//! Compensated summation is no defence on this backend: wgpu compiles Metal
//! shaders with fast-math on, which folds a `two_sum`. So the arithmetic is
//! arranged so that nothing cancels, by three exact rewrites:
//!
//! * **The offset term leaves the likelihood.** With `d_c = t_c - ln T_c -
//!   ln(v s) + z` and `s = sum_c k_c`, `sum_c k_c d_c - s z = sum_c k_c t_c -
//!   sum_c k_c ln T_c - s ln(v s)`. The pair `sum_c k_c d_c` and `s z`, each of
//!   order `1e6` for an expressed gene, never forms.
//! * **Every per-cell term is of order one.** The stationarity condition is
//!   `omega_c = v k_c - d_c`, so the offset residual `sum_c omega_c - v s` is
//!   `-sum_c d_c`, an empty cell's log fold change is `-omega_c`, and the two
//!   large likelihood terms, `k_c ln omega_c` and `ln(1 + omega_c)`, split into
//!   an anchor the host knows exactly plus `ln(1 - d_c / (v k_c))` and
//!   `ln(1 + (1 - d_c) / (v k_c))`. See `kernels::sweep`.
//! * **The host assembles the likelihood.** The device returns only the five
//!   sums; the combination, which does cancel, happens in `f64`.
//!
//! Without the second rewrite, the sums were of order `v s` and `K ln K`. On a
//! simulated gene holding a quarter of the reads (`K = 2.6e6`) that left its log
//! fold changes `1.6e-2` of an error bar from the CPU's, above the 1% to which
//! the grid itself is resolved ([`crate::config::DEFAULT_VARIANCE_BINS`]).
